# Copilot Instructions
- Project is Astro 5 targeting Cloudflare Workers; source root is set to `src/client` and Cloudflare adapter/image service is configured in [astro.config.mjs](astro.config.mjs#L1-L26).
- Pages live in [src/client/pages](src/client/pages) and route by filename; current home page composes [Hello](src/client/components/Hello.astro) and [Slogan](src/client/components/Slogan.astro) through the shared [layout](src/client/layouts/layout.astro).
- Layout pulls in global styles and head metadata; global styles use Tailwind v4 directives, DaisyUI plugin, and Iosevka font declared in [src/client/styles/global.css](src/client/styles/global.css).
- Tailwind is wired via Vite plugin (no config file needed) and DaisyUI plugin is registered in CSS using `@plugin "daisyui"`.
- Slogan component instantiates `typed.js` on `#slogan` with looping phrases; ensure any additions keep the DOM id stable or update the selector accordingly.
- React is available via `@astrojs/react` integration; use React components where needed, but keep Astro pages as the routing surface.
- TypeScript inherits Astro strict config and adds React JSX settings in [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json#L1-L17); Wrangler-generated worker types are included via [worker-configuration.d.ts](worker-configuration.d.ts) (do not edit).
- Cloudflare deploy settings live in [wrangler.jsonc](wrangler.jsonc#L1-L26): compatibility date `2025-12-12`, flags `nodejs_compat` and `global_fetch_strictly_public`, assets binding `ASSETS` served from `./dist`.
- Package scripts (run with Bun): `bunx --bun astro dev` (dev), `astro build` (build), `astro build && wrangler dev` (preview against local worker), `astro build && wrangler deploy` (deploy), `wrangler types` (update worker-configuration), `ultracite check|fix` (lint/format via Biome presets).
- Commit messages are linted via Lefthook `commit-msg` hook running `bun run commitlint --edit {1}` per [lefthook.yml](lefthook.yml).
- Formatting/linting style: Biome with Ultracite presets, 2-space indent, line width 100, double quotes for JS/TS, Tailwind directives enabled in CSS, JSON formatting disabled for `.json` (biome is off there).
- Font assets and favicons are expected in `public`; manifest is referenced from the layout head.
- Astro adapter uses Cloudflare platform proxy; images go through Cloudflare image service—prefer using Astro `<Image />`/service-friendly assets when adding media.
- When adding new environment bindings, configure them in `wrangler.jsonc` (vars/secrets/services) and surface types via regenerated `worker-configuration.d.ts` using `bun run cf-typegen`.
- Prefer keeping pages lean and moving UI into components under `src/client/components`; share layout-level styles or head tags in the layout instead of per-page duplication.
- If adding client scripts, prefer Astro islands or React components; if using inline scripts like Slogan, keep selectors unique and avoid polluting global scope.
- Deployment output is Worker-first; ensure any server-side APIs rely on Cloudflare-compatible APIs (fetch, caches) rather than Node-only modules.
- Use Bun for dependency tasks; lockfile is `bun.lock` (kept in repo), and `type: module` is set in [package.json](package.json#L1-L29) (use ESM syntax).
 - Dev server runs on http://localhost:4321 by default when using `bunx --bun astro dev`.
 - Worker bundle emitted to `dist/_worker.js/index.js` per [wrangler.jsonc](wrangler.jsonc#L1-L12); avoid manual edits in `dist` (build artifacts).
 - No automated tests are present; smoke-test locally via dev server and `wrangler dev` preview before deploying.
